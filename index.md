## Lecture 1-2

Contributor: Hongyi

### 1. Why does generator operate at synchronous speed?

Because the AC grid is operating at a fix frequency.

### 2. Why do we need voltage control?

Voltage control is essential to maintain the reactive power in the system within the controllable region. Maintaining the voltage within the limits is also necessary for the insulation of the devices.

### 3. Which of voltage and frequency control can be influenced by the network?

Voltage control. To control the frequency, it requires the injection of the active power, which is not possible by changing the network.

### 4. How does one characterise lightening strikes in transmission line?

The peak value (usually in kiloampere) and the duration (typical value 1.2/50 microseconds).

### 5. How does one characterise switching transient in transmission system?

By the magnitude of the over voltage and the duration. (Typical value for 400 kV system, 2 times the rated voltage and 200~2000 microseconds)

### 6. What types of power plant exhibit mechanical resonance in the sub synchronous frequency range?

All power plants that utilize multi-state/pressure-compounded turbines.

### 7. What type of stability study is important for assessing the fault behaviour of synchronous generator?

Trasient stability. Transient stability problem usually arises when the output power of the generator drops, while subsynchronous resonance usually comes from network side, especially which is series compensated.

### 8. What is of prime importance in small signal stability studies? 

Dumping is a critical parameter in such studies.

### 1. What are the functionsof closed circuit rotor windings?

In majority of the cases additional windings, known as damper winding, are included to produce damping effect. These windings are closed and their dissipative action produce damping to rotor oscillations.

### 2. Why should the synchronous reactance be so high (1.5 to 2.0 p.u.)?

The reactance is in reverse proportional to the reluctance. In the design of the generator, the reluctance is always low to optimize the generator in terms of material and size.

### 3. Why should X/R ratio of a generator be so high?

The reactance is very high, due to the reasons stated in Q2.

The register of the circuit is designed to be as low as possible, since the conductors are conducting thousands of amperes. In order to reduce the thermal loss, the resistance should be low, resulting in a high X/R ratio (typical value around 300).

### 4. Can the generator be operated at theoretical maximum power? Justify your answer

No. If the generator is operated at maximum power, i.e. $\delta =90\degree$, it is not stable. For example, if the mechanic torque increases, which will lead to the increase in $\delta$, the electrical power output is supposed to increase as well to keep the system stable. However, if it is operating at maximum output, the ouput power will decrease, which will lead to a further increase of $\delta$ and the lost of synchronization.
